    How do i know the right course for me?

            How are classes delivered?

        <p>Details will vary by course, but in general we have a mix of online and in-person options that blend live lectures, exercises, video content, group work, and projects. 
            In most courses we try to prepare you for real working environments by being more hands on in the early weeks of your course, while requiring more self-directed study (with lots of help and resources available) in the last weeks of your course.</p>

                    Do I need any experience with coding?
                
                </h4>
                <p> There are two ways to answer this question.

 

                    First, our programs are designed so that people with basic computer literacy should be able to graduate. For instance, you don’t need to have been coding since the days of Fortran, but you should feel comfortable installing programs and apps on your computer without regularly asking someone for help.
                    
                     
                    
                    Second, all that said, we aren’t sure why anyone would choose to study something they have no experience with. A little experience with your subject will not only help you complete the course, but it will help you feel confident that you’re studying something you enjoy.</p>
                </div>
                
                
                </article>

                <article class="faq">
                    <div class="faq_icon"><i class="uil uil-plus"></i>
                    
                    </div>
                    <div class="question_answer">
                    <h4>
                        What if I don't like what I choose to study?
                    
                    </h4>
                    <p> Sometimes we take our best guess, start out on a path, and then realize we don’t like where we’re heading. No biggie.

                        Each program has a grace period where you can drop and only forfeit the seat deposit portion of your tuition (normally $149). After that, there is a longer prorated refund period. (For specific details on refund policies by course, contact our admissions department.)
                        
                        Also, students in the Web Development, Python Software Engineering, Java Software Engineering, Data Analyst, iOS App Development, and Cybersecurity programs can change their chosen area of specialization to any other program in the group within the first half of the course.</p>

                        </h4>
                        <p> First, you’ll fill out your personal information, which usually takes around 15 minutes.

 

                            Next, you’ll schedule a consultation with an admissions counselor. (This is our chance to make sure you’re a real person and your chance to ask any questions.) This can take 15-30 minutes.
                            
                             
                            
                            Finally, you’ll complete a skill review, which can give you an idea of whether you’re ready for the program or what you might need to work on first. This is done online and usually takes about 30 minutes.
                            
                             
                            
                            Once you’ve completed all that, you should receive an admissions decision. At that point, it’s up to you whether you want to move forward and enroll or pursue other options. There is no commitment until you make a seat deposit. </p>

                            <p>Neither we, nor anyone else in the universe, knows this for sure. (If we could predict the future, we’d be too busy getting kicked out of casinos.)

            <p>The course is structured as a small-group lab, so it's easy to stay engaged and you get a lot of hands-on experience coding. The instructor, Mr Malcolm, was an exceptional teacher and was very adaptive to the class. We got to spend time working on problems relevant for our jobs. Highly recommend</p>
